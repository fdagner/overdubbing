# Overdubbing

Overdubbing is a preset for the Moodle activity database.

## Description

The template can be used to add an audio track to a video via a microphone. Especially in science subjects, experiments or animations are often used to illustrate facts. In order to achieve a deeper understanding of this content, it is important to encourage intensive engagement with the content presented. Adding an audio track to a silent film is an easy way to get learners to work together and deepen their communication skills to create a collaborative learning product.

## Language Support
The preset is available in German, but there is not so much to translate. The template can easily be adapted.

## Getting started

Download the source code and zip the files WITHOUT parent folder or download the ZIP file. Create a "Database" activity in Moodle and then upload the ZIP file as a preset.

To embed another video, the video link must be adjusted in singletemplate and addtemplate.
